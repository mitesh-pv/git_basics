# Git Basics 

<p align="justify">Git is a version control or Source control system that helps a software team create and manage changes to the source code over time. It keeps track of every changes made to the source code in the form of snapshots that can be moved forward and backward as and when required. If any error occurs, the system can easily be rolled back to previous commit and comparisions can be made between the two versions of code to rectify the error. </p>
